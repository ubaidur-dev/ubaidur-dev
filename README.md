## Frontend Developer | Building Clean & Fast Web Applications
I am a Frontend Developer who enjoys turning design ideas into functional websites. My focus is on writing clean code that works smoothly on both mobile and desktop. I specialize in React.js and I am very comfortable working with Figma to create pixel-perfect interfaces.


## My Technical Skills
* **The Core:** HTML5, CSS3, and Modern JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Frameworks:** React.js (building reusable and organized components).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap for fast, responsive layouts.
* **Design & Workflow:** Converting Figma designs to code, using Git/GitHub for version control, and NPM/Vite for development.


## How I Work
* **Focus on Quality:** I don't just build things to make them work; I make sure the code is easy for other developers to read and maintain.
* **Design to Reality:** Because I understand Figma, I can translate designs into code exactly as the designer intended.
* **Responsive & Fast:** I make sure every project I work on is lightweight and looks great on every screen size.
* **Simple & Scalable:** I prefer building small, reusable parts (components) that can be easily managed as the project grows.


## Current Focus
I am currently working on improving my React skills and learning more about how to make web apps even faster and more secure.


## Technical Interests
* **Design Systems:** Building consistent UI libraries that can be used across multiple projects.
* **Architecture:** Thinking about how to structure folders and files so they stay clean as the app grows.
